## The importance of group members
having different group members is important while doing a project because each member can focus on different parts of the project to maximize the final product to excel in each part to the client. If there is no team dynamic in a team, then each member/ the team will have trouble completing parts of the project that they might not be experienced in.

### Introduction

This document specifies a design for the conceptual features and mechanics (gameplay) of a game with the provisional title “Greenhouse Menace”, commissioned by the Zoological Society of London. It is based on elements discussed in various meetings, held since 2nd October, between cliental (ZSL) and group members involving Matthew, Sam, Joe, Luke and Luke.

### User stories and objectives

With the project having quite a large scope, we needed to find a way to break up tasks in order to focus on individual sections of the project. In order to do this, we split the project into epics and stories, what this meant was that the project was able to be looked at from the small tasks and problems rather than the entire project as a whole. Doing this helped us look at the requirements for the user and also the software requirements within the project, by looking at these things individually, we were able to focus on the project much easier.

#### Epics

Epics are usually a task or problem that outlines the big tasks within the project, these can be broken down into stories that can help solve the problem down by looking at the individual smaller problems in the epic. User stories are epics that have been broken down into smaller tasks.

For example, a project will be to build a car, the epics would be to build an engine, framework, tyres etc. The stories of the framework epic would be small tasks to help it be successful. For example, I want to be able to fit 4 people in the car, this means that when planning it the team will look at this and make sure it is the right size. Another story could be I want the car to look nice, so the team will spend the next bit of time working on that specific point to make sure it meets a user's needs.

The epic of the project was to design an application that would be able to meet the user’s requirements to a certain standard. Because of this it meant that each requirement had to be looked at individually. This is where user stories were made, some examples of the user stories that were made was:

##### I want to be able to navigate the menu by clicking onto it,

##### I want to be able to go to whichever habitat in any order I want,

##### I want to be able to have an option that tells me what to do in case I don't understand,

With these stories and many more we were able to have a look at all the user requirements and put them in their own tasks, which made us focus more on the individual tasks that were important to the requirements of the user and know exactly what software we needed to use in order to help us achieve them. Because of these stories and epics we were able to manage our time and efficiency onto what the user needed instead of what the team think are good to have.

### Project Management Plan 

In order to get the correct product to the client, the team met up and made sure that we were all on the same page when it came to the same IDE's we would be using to the right programming language and what timetable that we would have. We met on several occasions regarding points about the app and how it would work, the first meeting was for information on the project, this was followed by a pitch meeting, this was where we had a design for our app. Through our presentation we were able to accurately show how the app was going to work, this allowed for feedback in what was good and bad in our app and we were able to use that for improvement to the app.

Before meetings there where some issues with the PowerPoint presentation as it had been created in google docs then transferred over to Microsoft PowerPoint, however those problems where managed to be fixed before the pitch had started. As well as this the group made handouts for the clients to make sure that any information that was missed or not communicated properly would still be showed to the client. With these handouts we were able to resolve an issue with the app before it was too late to have any big impact on the design process.

After meeting we made sure to cover all of the risks and problems that we could encounter on the project. For example, if someone was to have issues with a certain part of building the program, would there be help from the team and if so, was there flexibility within the group to help. We took these risk into consideration and tried to make technical solutions to each of them. With us doing this it meant that most of the risks that could have been prevented were, this process saved much time and resources and allowed us to use our time much more effectively in the project.

## Cost
£39 Unity licence
Cost of our tutor getting mini-van licence so we can visit ZSL Whipsnade to present our app
Around £500 per member for a desktop computer, keyboard and mouse to complete tasks
£20 for any needed assets for our app to make it look more appealing to ZSL

## Scope

This documentation is meant to be read by programmers, artists and producers involved in the design implementation and testing of “Greenhouse Menace”. The App is for a target age of 12-15 year olds, along with this the app has to be very informative and interactive, ZSL required these for the app to be successful.

## Time
We were given the first brief from ZSL on the 2nd of October and we have until the 7th of November where we will be presenting the final demo for our app.

## How we will Assure Quality
We will assure quality in our app, by first creating a detailed development plan in the form of a Gantt chart, this is so we can assure that we know how much time we should be spending on each task, meaning that we manage our time effectively and allows us to be aware when we are falling behind. Another way we will assure quality is by vigorously testing our app once we feel development has been completed. This will make sure we find and fix any errors or bugs within the app, to assure that it works properly when we present the app to ZSL.

## Communication
Our group will meet 3 times a week at the college, during these meetings we will discuss our progress on our tasks and what tasks we need to do for the upcoming week. While we are not at the college we will create a group on Facebook for the purpose of discussing the project, we will use this group to ask for help on tasks. We will also create a google drive so that we can share the work we complete, this will allow us to use any work that is needed for other tasks and assure we are all working up to date.

## Risks
#### Hardware Issues:
During the development process some hardware of a computer that we are using may become faulty, this would massively delay development as the user of that computer would not be able to complete any of their tasks until that computer is fixed. This delay could prevent us from completing this project for the deadline. To reduce this risk, we will make sure that we are using multiple computers with the required software to get our work done, i.e. one computer and one computer at home, so that if an issue happens with one system work can continue on the other.

#### Schedule Issues:
Another risk is that we do not assign our time to do tasks correctly, this could be an issue because, for example, if we assign too little time for a task, we will obviously become behind schedule which could either lead to more time being wasted to correct the schedule, or we will have to skip tasks so we can keep to the schedule. None of these choices are ideal so it is ideal that our schedule is as realistic as possible. To assure we do not assign too little time for a task, we will make sure we give more than adequate time for each task, this makes sure that the tasks will be completed within the given timeframe and if completed with time to spare means that tasks can be worked on ahead of schedule.

#### Personal Issues:
During the development process a member/ members may be struck with illness or personal issues, this would result in them being unable to continue development until the issue was resolved, which could result in our app not being completed by the deadline set by the client. This risk will be reduced by making sure we have access to the work we are completing, this makes sure that if a member is disposed we can access their work and complete their tasks until they can work again. This may slow development time in the short-term but it assures that we can continue development in-spite of a member not being available, instead of having to pause development until they can work again.

## Resources
#### Microsoft PowerPoint:
We will need this software when we present our concept pitch and our final design and demo to the client. This software will be helpful as it will be able to present our pitches for the app in a clear and structured manner.

#### Unity:
Unity will be the software we use to construct our app. Unity is a game engine that will help us in the construction of menus and scenes in our app.

#### Microsoft Excel:
This software is used for creating spreadsheets. We will use excel to create Gantt charts to plan out the amount of time we will spend on each aspect of the software development, so we can manage our time effectively.

#### At least 5 Desktop computers:
This is so we can have a computer for each member of our team, this means that we can all be developing our app at the same time, increasing the efficiency of our work.

#### Internet Connection:
This is so we can be connected up to the internet, this is so we can research solutions to possible problems that could occur during the development process.



### Feedback

On parts of the ZSL project, there were meetings on the project to show what the app was looking like and if it was going in the right direction of what they wanted. The feedback that our group got on the first pitch was very eye-opening as it showed us that we had been going in a wrong direction with our app. The feedback that we got that our app was not informative enough and interactive sides of it were lacking allowed us to look back at our app and make changes to the app to fit the client’s needs. This included changing the interactive side of it completely as well as adding in more parts to make it more informational.

## Qualitative and quantitative research

When building the application, we needed to research whether people found the application fun and interactive, this meant that we would have to use surveys in order to find out the applications quality with multiple people. In order to do this, we did two types of research, qualitative and quantitative research meant that we were able to get lots of information in order to improve the app. We invited people into the class to test our game.

| Name          | Rating 1-10   | Other feedback  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---------------:|
|Ciaran Smith| 6 | The application looks good however needs to be a bit slower so I can take in the information|
|Matthew Senior| 8 |  The information would clear and the drag and drop was fun, but the art style is a bit bland|
|Michael Chhina| 4 | I found the art style bad as well as the information that it gave me, may need better explanation of what to do|
|Mark Biswell| 3 | The art style is not very pleasing to look at and the information is not very suited for the purpose of the app | 

Because of this feedback we were able to change the application to help meet not only the client’s needs but all the user's needs as well. In order to make sure the changes were made properly, we devised more aims and objectives in order to allow the team focus only on what needed to be changed and not change things that didn’t need to be. Because of this the application was improved successfully.

## Analysing the data using tools and techniques

After gathering the data with the survey, we needed to analyse the data and make sure that we can get the right aims and objectives.

### Mind maps
for this we used mind maps for the feedback to think about how to put it to use. We came together and looked at the feedback from the research and what to do with it. Not only for how we were going to analyse the data but also how we were going to solve the problems that the feedback gave us.

### Effective analysis
We created tables of possible solutions to the problems the feedback gave us and checked if the solutions would work based on how effective they would be. When using the mind map, we were able to draft some solutions to problems and see if they would work, here we analysed each solution from having a full re-build to attempting to change the whole style of the app, all solutions required work and time and in the end using this technique allowed us to find the best solution which was for us to all work on research and changing the information whilst Luke Bruni worked on the art style.

### Drawing conclusions from the data

The information we received was very helpful when looking at the problems of our application, with the art style and information being the two points we needed to focus on, we needed look at the conclusions we could draw, with the effective analysis tool, we once again were able to look at all different conclusions to the feedback. By looking at the feedback and the issue with the art style of the game, we came to the conclusion that it needed to be changed as the data showed us that three out of the four people had a problem with the art style and as of such it should be changed. Because of this Luke Bruni did some changes to make it look more visually appealing and we changed the information to make it much clearer. 

### Concept

The aim is to produce a game which suits the client’s requirements, creating an educational application that is informative, engaging and interactive based on the proposed or pre-set subject (In this instance; Greenhouse gases, production, Manufacturing and the impact of said gases and manufacturing or production phases on the environment in addition to the influence on climate change). 

### Story 

The story relates to the greenhouse gases and chain, of the production and manufacturing process of four products to four habitats. The user is presented with the production and manufacturing process or segments of the greenhouse gas chain and are then responsible or asked to recreate the chain after viewing the process once. Moreover, once the chain is completed the user is then presented with what could be done to help alleviate the problem or rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted, which links in to the pledges the user is then shown and asked to pick at least one pledge to enact in their daily lives.

### Setting

This game will be set in the present/modern day. 

### Application Structure 

The Menu will consist of four images, each representation a different area or environment. 
In the application all areas will be unlocked automatically to give the user a choice as to which area they may want to begin with.

![Game Menu](https://github.com/LukeShead/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Mockup%20App%20Menu.png)


Furthermore, the graphic styles within the environments and menu will be consistent throughout, though what is represented within each area and the colour palette will change so that differentiation may be made for the 4 different areas (Tundra, Rain Forest, British countryside and the Ocean).

Once an area or habitat has been clicked on a comic strip will be shown spanning one to two scenes (pages) showing the manufacturing and production process of a product relevant to that environment. Moreover, after the comic strips have faded the game screen will appear with an empty chain and numerous drag gable images, which need to be put by a user in a specific order. 

After the greenhouse gas chain has been completed and put into the correct order, more images are presented showing what could be done to help alleviate the amount of gases released, with pledges then being presented once the images have been removed from the screen with the user given a choice.

Moreover, once a pledge has been chosen the user will then be taken (transitioned) back to the main menu screen.

### Players | Platform

The application will adhere to 11-16 year olds, being compatible on the following system;

Apple-IPAD-IOS-Chrome

The application itself though not built with multiplayer, may be used by multiple people through sharing one system or machine and straightforward discussion (as to what should be inputted).

### Genre 

	2D

	Educational

	Memory Game

### Intended Audience

The intended audience of the game is for casual or non-gamers of all genders spanning from the age of 11 to 16, however the primary age range is 11 to 12 years old.

### Sound Consideration

The game is not sound dependant since it was requested by the client (no sound or audio).

### Language 

The only language available in the game will be English. 

## Game Mechanics | InGame Elements

### Camera 

The camera will be projected from a 2D front side angle of the menu, comics, pledges and chain.

### General Movement

The users will be able to drop and drag certain objects across the screen (for the chain segment).
Whilst users will also be able to use the tap function (on the menu and comic slides to transition between scenes).

### Fonts

In game Font: 
Jupiter (Menu,Game Screen)

Group Name: Ducks and Bucks

Group Members: Luke Shead, Joe Williams, Sam Dearing, Matthew Sides, Luke Bruni

Project Definition

Create an app for ZSL that teaches students how greenhouse gases are produced and how they affect certain habitats. Students will be required, at the end of the session, to create a pledge of how they can reduce their greenhouse footprint.
Project Specification

ZSL has given us the task of creating a web based application for children aged 11-16 which will be used in their climate change sessions. The purpose of the app is to teach students how greenhouse gases are produced and the effects they have of habitats and show them what they/society can do to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases. The app will need to include 4 habitats with their own greenhouse chain that will be displayed to the user: Artic (Plastic Bottles), British Wildlife(Beef), Ocean (Leaving electronics on standby/oil rigging), rainforest (Mobile phones). At the end of the app students will need to create ‘pledges’ of how they will reduce their greenhouse footprint.

#### Monday 2nd- 8th
We first started with a 1-hour sprint to put our ideas together, we began brainstorming ideas of what the main gameplay of the game would be. We decided to go with an item finding game where the user would have to find certain items in environments, which would give the user information based on each item (how greenhouse gases are created by the item etc.). We also decided on a main menu where the user would be able to decide which environment they would be using (this would depend on the environment table they are at in the ZSL session). We then spent the rest of the week fine tuning this idea and creating concepts of how the app interface would look. In our second sprint on the 5th we then decided on the aesthetic of the app, we decided upon using a comic book style as we felt that would be appealing for the children using the app.

This week’s sprints first started with our group meeting and discussing what we had achieved before the first week, Luke Shead had created the pitch presentation, Joe and Matthew had created some storyboards of how the app would function, Luke Bruni had created some concept art of the main menu and the artic habitat background and Sam had started the backlog of the previous sprints we had completed. Once we had confirmed that the tasks from last week were complete, we then assigned each other tasks that we needed to complete within a 45-minute timeframe (See in table sprint 1). This sprint was focused on our pitch and adding details to certain parts of our pitch, for example we needed to add more details to our storyboard to include the part where the students would give their pledges. Once we had completed the tasks we took an hour break then moved onto our second sprint. This sprint was more focused on how we would manage our project (see in table sprint 2); a way we are doing this is by creating user stories, so we have clear simple tasks that we can complete in our sprints.

### Software analysis tools/techniques 
## Client meetup
during this project we had a meeting with the client. we made our way to the client in October to discuss what the project will include. we discussed what changes needed to be made to the project to better suit the client’s idea. This was done so that the finished product was the best that we could do for the client’s needs. We interviewed the client to get their input on the project and to see if our project was lining up with their needs. later, in the project we showed them a prototype of the game to show the techniques and ideas that was put into the project.

## Tools used
there were many different tools used to communicate with the client and create the project. these include software such as text editors (Microsoft word), presentation editors (Microsoft PowerPoint), image editing software (Photoshop) and unity to create the game. The software that was used needed to be investigated to make sure that it suitable for the business and for the requirements it provided.

### How Can Technical Solutions Be Compared
In order to find the right tools to use for the client’s needs technical solutions need to be created for requirements that the client has requested. These technical solutions offer multiple answers to the client’s problems and gives the client and the developer multiple choices on how to proceed and which software to use. For example, though testing different software and application we came to the conclusion that unity was the best choice to create the application in. The client had no input on the choice and gave us the choice of development software.

These technical solutions can be compared by seeing which outcome is better for the client by creating short test applications and demos of the product and seeing which is better suited to the client’s needs.

Fitness: Is the software suitable for the current problem and is there a better solution to the problem.

Maturity: It's risky to use the first version of anything, including software. Both hardware and software development companies are frequently pressured to release products before they are ready. This can lead to issues with the product being found by users after release.

Support: Is there any backup for the system if it goes down. Support is needed in case of emergencies. It is also safe and secure to make sure these supports are in place just in case.

License and support costs: The software and support for the technology used may pose a problem. The cost of upkeep and the use of software and the backup/support need to keep things together will need to be taken into account.

## Critical reasoning 
one area was critical reasoning was used during development was the educational expect of the project. During development the educational expect was pushed aside for more of a gameplay expect. after discussing with the client we decided that the educational expect of the project needs to be the main aspect of the app.

## Communication with ZSL
A range of different communication styles and formats were used during the event to essentially better convey the groups ideas and points across to the client. For instance, verbal communication, effective during the presentation as are groups presenter (in this instance Luke Shead) was concise, stating the ideas behind the design, a walkthrough of the given prototype also covering the parts omitted form the project due to time constraints.

In Addition to verbal communication, Visual formats were also used. For example, power point, to provide an illustrative backdrop for the content of said presentation and support (back-up) the words spoken by the presenter. Another visual format also enforced was the use of a demo, prepared specifically for this scenario or event. These visual formats were essentially used effectively during the event as the inclusion of said demo provided quality assurance and a better illustration as to what the client might expect the finished application to function and look like aesthetically. Whilst the presentation and the way in which it was utilised was effective due to the following of the 6 slide rule, short and concise, stating what the presenting is verbally conveying. Further being used to engage the client, diverting attention off the presenter, thus alleviating the pressure.

Such examples of communication used were email and face-to-face.

## Problem solving techniques
This section will contain different problem solving techniques that were used during the development of this project.

#### Trial and error
this style of problem solving is to find a solution to a problem through repetitive trails to try to make the problem smaller and smaller until the problem is non-existent. This was done a lot during the ZSL project and the biggest example was the final stages of the project when it would not work on the tables. We each tried different trails of the game with different fixies to see if they would work. After some time, a solution was found because of this problem solving technique.

#### Data collection
By making sure relevant information is collected, team members can develop a more suitable response. This problem solving technique was used shortly after a brief was received from ZSL, during requirement gathering making inquiries into what ZSL would expect, querying to essentially feed ideas, making suggestions and gaining a better understanding of the overall expectations to ensure that the response or presentation was what the client asked for.

#### Problem breakdown
problem breakdown is when a problem is when a problem is split into different smaller problems to make them easier to handle and fix. This was a general solution to a lot of problems that were brought up during the development stage of the project. It had sure that problems with the game were easy to fix and were not too big or overwhelming to handle.
