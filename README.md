## GameOverview

### Introduction

This document specifies a design for the conceptual features and mechanics (gameplay) of a game with the provisional title “GreenHouse Menace”, commissioned by the Zoological Society of London. It is based on elements discussed in various meetings, held since 2nd October, between cliental (ZSL) and group members involving Matthew, Sam, Joe, Luke and Luke.

### Scope

This documentation is meant to be read by programmers, artists and producers involved in the design implementation and testing of “GreenHouse Menace”.


## Specification

### Concept

The aim is to produce a game which suits the client’s requirements, creating an educational application that is informative, engaging and interactive based on the proposed or pre-set subject (In this instance; Greenhouse gases, production, Manufacturing and the impact of said gases and manufacturing or production phases on the environment in addition to the influence on climate change). 

### Story 

The story relates to the green house gases and chain, of the production and manufacturing proccess of four products to four habitats. The user is presented with the production and manufacutring proccess or segments of the green house gas chain and are then responsible or asked to recreate the chain after viewing the proccess once. Moreover once the chain is completed the user is then presented with what could be done to help alleviate the problem or rate at which green house gases are emmitted, which links in to the pledges the user is then shown and asked to pick at least one pledge to enact in their daily lives.

### Setting

This game will be set in the present/modern day. 

### Application Structure 

The Menu will consist of four images, each representating a different area or enviroment. 
In the application all areas will be unlocked automatically to give the user a choice as to which area they may want to begin with.

Furthermore the graphic styles within the enviroments and menu will be consistent throughout, though what is represented within each area and the colour palette will change so that differentiation may be made for the 4 different areas (Tundra, Rain Forest, British countryside and the Ocean).

Once an area or habitat has been clicked on a comic strip will be shown spanning one to two scenes (pages) showing the manufacturing and production proccess of a product relevant to that enviroment. Moreover after the comic strips have faded the game screen will appear with an empty chain and numerous draggable images, which need to be put by a user in a specific order. 

After the green house gas chain has been compeleted and put into the correct order, more images are presented showing what could be done to help alleviate the amount of gases released,with pledges then being presented once the images have been removed from the screen with the user given a choice.

Moreover once a pledge has been chosen the user will then be taken (transitioned) back to the main menu screen.

### Players | Platform

The application will adhere to 11-16 year olds, being compatible on the following system;

Apple-IPAD-IOS-Chrome

The application itself though not built with multiplayer, may be used by multiple people through sharing one system or machine and  straightforward discussion  (as to what should be inputted).
